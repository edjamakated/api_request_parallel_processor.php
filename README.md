# api_request_parallel_processor.php

## converted OpenAI cookbook Python example to PHP 

a work in progress

I've made a few improvements to the code. The main changes include:

Introduced a RateLimiter class to handle rate limiting in a more structured manner.
Added a handle_error method in the APIRequest class to process different types of errors.
Updated the call_api method in the APIRequest class to handle rate-limiting errors.
Enhanced the StatusTracker class to make it more informative.
Improved the error handling in the process_api_requests_from_file function.
